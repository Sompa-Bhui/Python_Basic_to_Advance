# 🧮 Variables in Python

## 📌 What are Variables?

**Variables** are like containers that **store data**.  
They are **memory placeholders** used to store values and data types that your program can use or modify.

> 🔹 Think of a variable like a labeled jar — you put something inside (value), and use the label (variable name) to find or change it.
